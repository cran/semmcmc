Description: Provides Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) routine for the 
             structural equation modelling described in 
             Maity et. al. (2020) <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa286>. This MCMC sampler is 
             useful when one attempts to perform an integrative survival analysis for multiple 
             platforms of the Omics data where the response is time to event and the 
             predictors are different omics expressions for different platforms.
